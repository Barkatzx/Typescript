# üöÄ TypeScript Problem Set

This repository contains a collection of **10 TypeScript problems** designed to strengthen your understanding of core TypeScript concepts such as data types, objects, optional properties, literals, functions, and more.

## üìù Problems

### **01. Problem (Data Types)**

Create a function that accepts a string and a number, and returns a string combining both values. Ensure the function is strongly typed.

### **02. Problem (Object)**

Define an object type for a user with `name`, `age`, and an optional `email`. Then create a user object with appropriate values.

### **03. Problem (Optional Properties)**

Define an interface for a Product with `name` and `price` as required properties, and `discount` as optional. Create a product object without the `discount` property.

### **04. Problem (Literal Types)**

Create a type `Status` that can only be `"success"`, `"error"`, or `"pending"`. Write a function that takes this `Status` type and logs a message based on the value.

### **05. Problem (Function)**

Write a strongly typed function that accepts two numbers and an operation (`"add" | "subtract" | "multiply"`) and returns the result of the operation.

### **06. Problem (Spread & Rest Operator)**

Write a function that accepts multiple numbers using the rest operator and returns their sum. Use the spread operator to add additional numbers to an existing array.

### **07. Problem (Destructuring)**

Given an object `{ name: "Barkat", age: 25, location: "Narsingdi" }`, use destructuring to extract `name` and `age` into variables.

### **08. Problem (Union & Intersection Types)**

Define a union type `Vehicle` that can be either a `Car` or `Bike` object. Also, define an intersection type for a `FlyingCar` that has properties of both `Car` and `Airplane`.

### **09. Problem (Ternary and Nullish Coalescing)**

Write a function that takes a number or `undefined`. Return `"Invalid"` if the value is `null` or `undefined`, otherwise return `value * 2`.

### **10. Problem (Never, Unknown, and Nullable)**

- Write a function with a `never` return type that always throws an error.
- Create a variable with the `unknown` type, assign different values, and demonstrate type checking.
- Write a nullable type for a string and initialize it with `null`.

Feel free to contribute solutions or discuss these problems! Happy coding! üòä
