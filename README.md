# TypeScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my TypeScript learning repository! ðŸš€

This project serves as a collection of notes, examples, and exercises as I dive into TypeScript, a powerful superset of JavaScript that brings static typing to JavaScript development. Here, I'm exploring the core concepts and features of TypeScript to deepen my understanding of type safety and improve my JavaScript skills.

## About This Repository

As a new learner, I'll be gradually building out this repository with:

- **Basic Concepts** â€“ Setting up TypeScript, learning about types, interfaces, and more.
- **Advanced Topics** â€“ Exploring generics, modules, type assertions, and other advanced features.
- **Hands-On Exercises** â€“ Simple projects and exercises to practice what I've learned.
- **Useful Resources** â€“ Links to documentation, tutorials, and other TypeScript learning materials.

## Goals

1. Understand the basics of TypeScript and how it integrates with JavaScript.
2. Learn how to use TypeScriptâ€™s type-checking capabilities to catch errors early.
3. Build projects that utilize TypeScript for safer and more maintainable code.

## Getting Started

If youâ€™re interested in following along, hereâ€™s how to get started:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Barkatzx/Typescript.git
   ```

2. **Install TypeScript:**
